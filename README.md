# Quarantine and testing strategies to reduce transmission risk from imported SARS-CoV-2 infections: a global modelling study

The main script to run the analysis is `main_script.R`. Set a name for your results in `results_name` and then run the rest of the script. Your results will be returned as a list of data frames for each scenario you have run and saved as a `.fst` in `/results/"results_name"`.

Figures can be generated by running `prop_detected_figures.R`, `imported_cases_figures.R`, `r_reduction_figures.R`, `uk_exports_variant_figure.R` and `pre_flight_delay_figure.R`.
